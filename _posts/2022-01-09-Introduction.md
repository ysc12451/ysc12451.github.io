# Welcome

I am a second-year PhD student in Statistics at University of Wisconsin-Madison. After passing the qualification exam, I am actively exploring towards high-dimensional statistics, biostats, machine learning and other modern topics with their applications in data analysis. Before becoming a graduate student in statistics & mathematics, I was an undergraduate major in physics and minor in economics, since when I gradually developed strong interest in data science. At that time, I obtained experience as a quantitative researcher (intern) in financial data analysis, and strengthened my desire to apply and develop mathematical tools in the real-world problems.
